This program intends to showcase the food culture of the Sinophere. In an ideal state it was and is intended to give those outside of the region a glimpse beyond take-out food varieties often enjoyed just as much in the West as "authentic" Chinese food. Authentic here refers to the method of preparation and keeping true to roots, not so much whom is cooking the food. 

I was inspired to make this after stumbling across the Youtube channel "Chinese Cooking Demystified" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw. The initial goal of this app was to allow a user to select a certain type of cuisine or region of China/the Sinosphere they would like to explore, and give recipies that complemented that type of cuisine. For instance if a user wanted to try making Szichuan food, there would be a number of classic and modern recipies from the Szichuan region. At the time of initial creation, due to the deadline imposed, I did not feel confident trying to create a functioning map-based product, so instead opted for descriptions of the food and a link-based navigation. That will be one major thing I shall add over time.
